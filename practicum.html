                    I was assigned to the Business Analytics team, where I worked on developing interactive dashboards and reports using Power BI. My tasks involved data cleaning, transformation, writing DAX measures, and creating visuals to support data monitoring. I also completed a case study that simulated real-world sales reporting, helping consolidate and analyze business data across multiple sources.

                    Over the course of the internship, I rendered a total of 350 hours from May 12, 2025 to June 10, 2025. The hours were distributed across three structured phases. Phase 1 focused on general IT and soft skills, accounting for 48 hours of foundational training.
